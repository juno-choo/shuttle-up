# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

## Firebase Keys

To connect to your own firebase project you will need to update the firebase config located in `src/lib/firebase/config.ts` with the keys for your own project.

You can get these keys by going to your Firebase console and then under project settings. Then click on the `General` tab and scroll down to `Your apps` you will find the config for web.
